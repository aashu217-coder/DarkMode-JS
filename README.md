###

### **About the Project:**  
You built a **theme switcher** that toggles between light/dark modes using:  
- **DOM Manipulation** (JS to dynamically update CSS classes)  
- **localStorage** (saves user preference for persistence)  
- **CSS Variables** (for efficient theme management)  
- **Smooth Transitions** (UX polish with `transition` properties)  

### **Why It Matters:**  
1. **Core JS Skills:** Mastered DOM events (`click`), `classList`, and `localStorage`.  
2. **Real-World Use:** Used by sites like Twitter, GitHub, and YouTube.  
3. **Scalable Approach:** CSS variables make it easy to add more themes later (e.g., "high contrast").  

### **Bonus Insight:**  
This mini-project is a gateway to **advanced frontend tools** like:  
- **React Context API** (for global state management)  
- **Tailwind Dark Mode** (utility-first theming)  
- **Prefers-Color-Scheme** (auto-detecting OS theme with `@media` queries)
